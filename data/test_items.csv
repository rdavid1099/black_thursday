They are currently a blend of blondes,blues, greens, pinks and purples, I think they look like space lol but obviously being my own hair these can be dyed any colour you like. Perfect for an undercut or extensions for your own dreadlocks. They are quite uniform in thickness, around sharpie thickness and slightly bigger.
